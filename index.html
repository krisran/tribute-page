					<h3>Biography</h3>
					<p>
						Paulo Freire was born in 1921 in Recife, Brazil. He grew up in a middle-class family during the Great Depression and the povery he witnessed during this period would be an important influence on his life, work, and philosophy. Freire began teaching while
						still in high school; he taught grammar to elementary school children. This experience imprinted on Freire how socioeconomic class, education, and knowledge can be interlinked. In 1943, Freire enrolled at the University of Recife, where he studied
						law, philosophy, and the psychology of language. In 1946, Friere was hired as the director of the Department of Education and Culture, which was an institution designed to help the poor gain literacy.
					</p>

					<h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
					<p>
						Freire worked mainly with illiterate, working class adults. Freire's goal was to help the working poor gain a political voice because the right to vote in Brazil was contingent on literacy at that time. Freire called the political exclusion of the poor
						a "culture of silence". As a result, Freire viewed illiteracy as both a social and technical problem that could alleviate economic inequality and activate political and social awareness.
					</p>
					<p>
						Freire's approach to teaching literacy was based on the acquisition of language skills and on the acquisition of a critical social consciousness meant to awaken the student's political and human agency. Freire thought that teaching should encompass a
						dialogue between teachers and students and that students should not be treated as passive consumers of knowledge. Freire stressed dialogue, discussion, and group work over the traditional lecture. He also developed curriculums that related to the
						lives of his adult students by acknowledging their life experiences, language, and knowledge and incorporating this content into his classes. An important goal of this technique was for his students to realise that culture is a human creation and
						that all people create culture and thus are capable of transforming their social and political environment.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p> “One cannot expect positive results from an educational or political action program which fails to respect the particular view of the world held by the people. Such a program constitutes cultural invasion, good intentions notwithstanding.”</p>
						<footer>Paulo Freire in <cite title="Source Title">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</cite></footer>
					</blockquote>


					<h3>Impact</h3>
					<p>
						Freire’s work has had a lasting impact. His most famous book, <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, is considered one of the founding texts of critical pedagogy; an educational philosophy designed to help students recognise the links between systems
						of power and systems of knowledge. His philosophy and work have influenced educators, philosophers, social workers, and community activists around the world.
